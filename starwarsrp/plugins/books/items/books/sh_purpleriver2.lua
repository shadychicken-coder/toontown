<h1>The Way of the Purple River: Book Two</h1>
<h3>By Unknown</h3>
<p>
There are many ways for one to follow The Way. Whether it be on their own, or in the midst of like minded individuals. But all who follow The Purple River must not fight. Rather, think of yourselves as pillars that uphold every tenet, every virtue, and every hope. Currently, there are Five main Sects of The Purple River, and each must utilize their strengths and help each other as we follow The Way. However, other minor sects are allowed and can be formed with only the utmost encouragement.

The Way Of Great Peace aims for peace at any cost. Where violence is found, so shall there be those who fight in the name of The Great Peace. While fighting should be seen as a last resort, it shouldn't be considered unthinkable. For when backed into a corner, every beast will fight to free itself, and so too should those who fight for the Great Peace. It was founded by the warrior known as Edusk Gotivo.

The Way of The Celestial Gate strides for the idea of forming holy lands for those who follow the Purple River. While not opposed to the idea of allowing outsiders to visit, they wish to establish a home for the worshippers of The Way, on any location they can. For not all peoples are welcoming of The Way. It's founder was known as Nor Stad.

The Supreme Mandate is the Sect of inner harmony and charity, making the majority of monks and nuns out of any of the sects. Permitted to having families and relations, they are still expected to spend much time studying and reflecting, to reach inner harmony and figuring the secrets of the soul. Their Founder was The Great Sorcerer, who founded the Way of The Purple River.
</br></br>
The Way Towards Enlightenment is the Sect of construction. Their aim has always been to preach The Way of The Purple River, to build shelters and settlements for the other sects and for the people in need. Mechanics, Builders, Engineers, and more tend to make up the majority of this Sect. Their Founder is unknown but believed to be the Goddess of Creation and Creativity.

The Way Of Eternal Tranquility is the group that has dedicated itself to ensuring that the dead pass to the afterlife peacefully. Sacrifices, burials, rituals, and mourning for the fallen are but a few things that The Way of Eternal Tranquility practice and strive for. Other things they do involve rituals of long life, teaching ways to keep people in the best of shape, and other practices of life. Their founder is Khars Thut.
