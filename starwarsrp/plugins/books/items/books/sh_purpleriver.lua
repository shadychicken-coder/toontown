<h1>The Way of the Purple River: Book One</h1>
<h3>By Unknown</h3>
<p>
Harmony and Disharmony are intertwined as light and dark. To achieve harmony, one should expect to go through Disharmony. As for one to reach the light, one may have to go through darkness.
</br></br>
For one to bring Harmony unto themselves, there are many tools one should strive for. Patience, Compassion, to go with the river, and to let go.
</br></br>
Patience with both friends and enemies, you are in accordance with how things are. Patience will see true friends grow closer, and Patience can also show whether one can make the enemy a friend, or if one would be better in avoidance.
</br></br>
Compassionate to yourself, and you can reconcile all beings within the galaxy. A compassionate heart will lift others up, simply by showing itself to others.
</br></br>
To let go of the complications of life, to rest and regain one's self, is to invite intelligent thought, calm words, long life, and happier outlooks on life
</br></br>
To Go with the River, rather than fight against it. Allow the River to guide you, to lead your path, and in the end you will always be successful. Do not force things to happen. And if you know not what to do, then do nothing until opportunity presents itself. When a river flows, and a rock threatens to stop it, the River will either go around it and continue on until it meets its destination, or remain at a stand still until the rock no longer stands in its path.
</br></br>
The biggest of all strengths, however, can also be frightening at first. When one realizes that all things change regardless of whether one desires them to or not, then one may resolve not to hold onto things they cannot bring with them. If one is willing to let go, to not be weighed down by the worries of change or even of death, then one will see many things open up.
</br></br>
To let go of your fear of change, and of your fear of death, one can achieve close to anything they desire, even godhood for those who remember them. 
</br></br>
Utilize these tools, and Disharmony will fall into Harmony. Chaos will break into Order. Hatred and bloodshed will collapse at the feet of Compassion and Life. And should Disharmony be fought with more than words and compassion but with arms of war, let it be swift, so that chaos can be subdued, and Harmony may return.
</br></br>
For there is nothing more gentle than water, but nothing can resist it's force.
