Greetings, from Sunny Mos Mesa!
</br></br>
Welcome to Mos Mesa, traveler. Whether you were brought here by a transport, born in a different settlement and migrated, or chased out by malcontents and Tusken Raiders, Mos Mesa has everything to keep you company.
</br></br>
In the Market place, you'll find a variety of wonderful attractions. From the Bakery that makes anything from regular bread to the finest cakes, to the friendly employees of the Tipsy Tusken, and even several doctors willing to help you, there is little you could want for. There is even an Imperial Permit Vender, for those of you Entrepreneurs and adventurers who seek to make Mos Mesa even sunnier!
</br></br>
In District One, you'll find the homes of Moisture Farmers who are glad for newcomers to lend an extra hand. Affordable homes for those strapped for cash can also be found here!
</br></br>
To help with the overall economy, don't be a stranger to the Imperial Mine! Facing the checkpoint, just head right and you can do your part in bringing our Empire to a brighter tomorrow! There are some houses nearby by, so don't hesitate to claim one! the closer you are to work, the less you have to walk there!
</br></br>
But let's not forget about the Mos Mesa hotel! A lovely establishment, delicately cared for and always kept in top shape by her owner, you'll be hard pressed to find anything negative about it. 
</br></br>
Our warmest welcome: </br>
          ~Sunny Mos Mesa
