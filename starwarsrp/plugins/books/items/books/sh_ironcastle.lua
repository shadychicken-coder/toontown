<h1>The Iron Castle</h1>
<h3>By Unknown</h3>
<p>
Everyday I wake from my recurring slumber, like the rest of us, and I look out upon the great Suns that greet us every morning with high hopes of fulfilling a promising and wonderful life; however, these hopes are quickly shot down as I look down upon the blights that plague our land like it's their own. You may ask, what are these blights I speak of? They walk among you like they are you, and they might even talk like you. Species such as Trandoshan, Wookie, Chiss, etc. are the society members I am speaking of. You may think, "They're still living creatures, don't they deserve a chance?" and I can see why some may think that, but these creatures steal precious job openings, form gangs, commit crime, and attempt to intimidate us Humans like they own us. I will not stand idly by as these creatures bully the dominant species around like cannon fodder. I will not watch as the society weâ€™ve built from the ground up is overrun by creatures from another domain.

Throughout history, speakers have had more power than pieces of literature, but I write this to hopefully one day inspire change among Humans, allowing them to rebuild their iron castle and lay siege upon the alien species that lay waste to our promise lands.   </br></br>
