## depots
these are usable entities that drop an item (random or not) after a short use time. they have a per use cd time and a full cd time, after a certain amount of uses they go on a full cd and return with full uses, if they arent used for a while they begin slowly regaining stock (if thats specified on the entity)
- there isnt too much to say about these, they dont autosave so youll need something like permaprops to save them
- there is scaling (use, cd, and fullcd times and less stock available) based on player count that can be edited in the base (sky_depot_base)
- see sky_depot_trash for a depot example, sky_depot_metalscrap is the depot mentioned in citjobs that is intended for use with the industrial worker job
